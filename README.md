# C Programming Explained Better: A Guide for Absolute Beginners

This project is just a workthrough of the book title above. Will update as I complete exercises. Hope to give a final rating at the end!

To run the examples, clone the repo in either WSL or a linux installation of your choosing. `mkdir bin obj` inside whichever chapter you intend to run the exercises. `make` to generate the binaries, `make run program_name` to run the exercise.
